facebook-codeigniter
====================

A facebook graph library for the CodeIgniter Framework. 

*IN DEVELOPMENT/NOT STABLE!*

This is a custom library that creates a class for the Facebook API to integrate into a CodeIgniter Application and defines simple functions for action items.

I am in the process of updating this to Facebook's newest SDK.

Last used with CodeIgniter 2.1

Library files should be placed in application/libraries/

History
---------------
I originally created this code as a proprietary library for use by my company. I have since used it in several applications and facebook apps. 

Considering Facebook applications are no longer in huge demand, I am releasing this library for use by anyone who is interested. I will update it when I have time, but feel free to suggest edits/updates.

*Facebook libraries are also included in this package - they are copyright Facebook.*
